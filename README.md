# On Approaching Software Design
My approach to designing software is to start with a high-level goal and break it down into smaller, more manageable components. For this project, the goal was to "create a realistic 3D desk scene," which I deconstructed into distinct parts: creating individual objects, arranging them in space, applying textures, and implementing a lighting system. A key design skill I crafted during this project was modular scene management. Instead of putting all the logic in one place, I followed a process where I planned for separate functions to handle specific tasks. For example, PrepareScene was designed to handle the one-time loading of all assets, while SetupSceneLighting was created to consolidate all lighting configurations. This tactic of separating data loading, lighting setup, and the actual rendering loop is incredibly valuable. This modular design approach can be applied to any future software project, as it leads to code that is cleaner, easier to debug, and far more scalable.

# On Approaching Program Development
While working on this 3D scene, a key development strategy was to adopt an iterative, piece-by-piece construction approach. The final scene was not built in one step. Instead, I started with a single object, the mug, and iterated on its development until it was correct. First, I focused on getting its shape to render correctly. Then, I iterated on the lighting until it was no longer black. After that, I iterated on the texturing. This process was repeated for every object, making debugging far more manageable. For example, when the globe stand was missing, the iterative process allowed me to isolate the problem by testing a solid color before worrying about its texture. My approach evolved significantly; I began by just trying to get code to work, but by the end, I was developing more systematically, thinking about what could go wrong and how to test each component in isolation. This iterative and diagnostic approach is essential for tackling any complex programming task.

# On How Computer Science Helps Reach My Goals
This project in computational graphics has provided new skills that are directly applicable to both my future education and professional career. Academically, it has transformed abstract mathematical concepts, such as linear algebra,  into tangible results—moving a camera is a direct application of matrix transformations. This provides a strong foundation for advanced fields such as data science, where visualization is key to understanding complex datasets, and artificial intelligence, which relies on computer vision to interpret 3D space. Professionally, the skills are even more direct. Beyond careers in game development or VR/AR, the core competencies are universal. The process of debugging a visual glitch, like the missing stand, hones the same problem-solving and diagnostic skills required to fix a bug in a database or web application. Learning to manage assets efficiently in PrepareScene is a lesson in performance optimization that applies to any software. This project has taught me how to break down a complex requirement into a functional, well-structured application—a skill that is at the heart of all software engineering.
